    <h1>This is my story of my trip</h1>
    <p>It had been a sunny morning and my mother yeld at me to get down here and I remembered that we were leaving for Outdoor Ed today (I mean my school was going of course).
        I put on my clothes and bolted down the stairs and wolfed down my cereal.
        Running outside, I grabbed my bag and permission form grabbed my bike and pedaled as fast as I could and arrived at the door panting and let out a sigh.
        My teacher asked me why I was late and I looked at the clock, turns out I was 2 minutes late. I sighed and told him that I had not heard my alarm and had rushed over.
        I sat down and heard the safety rules for the bus and we left for the bus. I put down my bag next to the bus and it was loaded in the bus. I sat down in my seat and
        slept until we arrivied
