    <p class="secondP"> The reason I want to get into MIT Is because the school is considered one of if not the best engineering
         schools, and as my dream job is being a structual engineer I would love it if I could get in.</p>
    <h3>What I will do if I get into MIT: The first thing I would do is find a job. I mean you know I'd love to avoid student loans if possible but 
        I dont think I can so gotta get a job you know.
        
        The second thing I would do is set up my dorm with my roomate and get to know him.

        And the Last thing I would do is just get through college.
